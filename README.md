<p>The object of the game is simple: You are controlling a snake that likes to eat food. Every time the snake eats some food it grows a little bit. You may not bite yourself in the tail or you are game over. There are no walls in this game so when you move outside of one side of the screen you appear again on the other side of the screen.</p>

<h2>How To Play</h2>

The objective of the game is to eat as many apples as possible without colliding with the walls or the snake's own body. As the snake eats more apples, it will grow in length and move faster.

You can control the direction of the snake using the arrow keys on your keyboard:
<ul>
  <li>Up: Press the up arrow key to move the snake upwards.</li>
  <li>Down: Press the down arrow key to move the snake downwards.</li>
  <li>Left: Press the left arrow key to move the snake to the left.</li>
  <li>Right: Press the right arrow key to move the snake to the right.</li>
</ul>
